# Issue template

This is the template to be used when adding opening a new issue for a GoBridge course. When in doubt, you may look up an existing issue. But no worries because you or GoBridge can always update things **anytime**!

When info is not yet available or unknown, include TBD in those fields and, no worries! We will keep coming back to the issue to update things as they get figured out, and a TBD helps us quickly visualize what has not been resolved yet.

But the more we know upfront the less we will have to ask you when we contact you, and maybe by then we will be able to quickly line up a few options for you.

Planning GoBridge workshops should be visible and transparent. Visibility makes it easier for us to help each other and show new organizers how we work. But make sure to not include confidential info, like people's phone numbers or email address (email us people's contact info when necessary.)
