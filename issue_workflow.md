# Issue Workflow

Issue categorization (labeling) is done by a GoBridge member who has ownership of the workshops repo and who self-assigns the issue.

### Issues are categorized by
- geographical location
- course name
- logistics attributes
- current status

#### About logistics attributes

These are the logistic attributes:
- has organizer
- has sponsor
- has venue
- has teacher
- has date

These are self-descriptive and are to be added only as these items are figured out.

#### About current status
An issue will maintain a current status from the moment that GoBridge gets in touch with the person who opened the issue.

- At the time the issue is open and the person is contacted, the status will be set to `contacted`.

- After discussing details over a Google Hangout and the event is a go (no pun intended,) in the issue thread, on the #gobridge channel, on our mailing-list, or via email, the issue will be set to the `in review` status. At this point, the GoBridge member and organizer(s) will be working together to check off on all [todo items](issue_template.md).

- **Only** after the event has all of the logistic items in place can it be set to the `scheduled` status.

- Issues that are inactive will be set to `on hold`.

- Issues that are in the past or are that have been inactive for too long will be closed.
