The GoBridge initiative:

GoBridge is an addition to the family of technical workshops that are a part of Bridge Foundry. Bridge Foundry is dedicated to building bridges that educate and empower underserved communities to teach technical skills and foster diversity in tech. To learn more about Bridge Foundry please check out their website, http://bridgefoundry.org.

GoBridge's main goal is to ensure that groups of underrepresented people and people with limited access to technology have as much an opportunity to teach and learn Go as anyone else. Access to all materials, classes and time will be always free to everyone. Learn more and get involved: http://golangbridge.org.
